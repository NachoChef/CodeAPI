# CodeAPI

A portion of my work for a Fall 2017 software engineering project was to complete a python code execution module capable of taking in information asynchronously via websocket and returning the code output. This API wraps that module so that it can be hit like a RESTful API.

It uses a very primitive "password" scheme, but that can easily be changed with flask.
